## What does this tool do?

This tool produces a JSON file per Proxy Repository that contains basic identity information for every Asset in the Repository.

A JSON files contents might look similar to this:

```json
[
      {
            "p": "/data-uri-to-buffer/-/data-uri-to-buffer-4.0.1.tgz",
            "h": {
                  "md5": "a4d7239289232437622e6342e771a153",
                  "sha1": "d8feb2b2881e6a4f58c2e08acfd0e2834e26222e",
                  "sha256": null
            }
      },
      ...
]
```

This tool purposefully skips Proxy Repositories of format `docker`.

## Installation

Obtain the binary for your Operating System and Architecture from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nexus-repo-asset-lister/releases).

You can see all options by running:

```
./nexus-repo-asset-lister -help

usage: nexus-repo-asset-lister [OPTIONS]
  -X    Enable debug logging
  -o string (optional)
        Directory to write asset lists to (default "~/nexus-repo-asset-lister")
  -password string (mandatory)
        Password used to authenticate to Sonatype Nexus Repository (can also be set using the environment variable NXRM_PASSWORD)
  -skipped (optional)
        Whether to ouptut skipped assets to a separate '-skipped.json' file
  -url string (mandatory)
        URL including protocol to your Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager (default "http://localhost:8081")

  -repository-name string (optional)

```

In order to produce the expected JSON files, you should run `nexus-repo-asset-lister` with Administrator credentials against your Sonatype Nexus Repository.

The URL of the Sonatype Nexus Repository sever is specified with the `-url` argument and should contain the protcol (e.g. `https://`) and any context path you may have set for the installation.

Credentials can be supplied as command-line arguments or via Environment Variables.

```
NXRM_USERNAME=username NXRM_PASSWORD=password ./nexus-repo-asset-lister -url https://my-nexus-repository.tld
```

You can use User Token instead of actual username and password.
